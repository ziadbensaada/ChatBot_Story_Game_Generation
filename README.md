# Chatbot for Generating Story Games from PDFs
Welcome to our innovative Chatbot project that generates story games with challenges based on the content of PDF documents. This project aims to provide users with an immersive storytelling experience, turning static PDF information into dynamic narratives filled with adventure and intrigue.

## Overview
This Chatbot utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning models, and PDF processing libraries to extract meaningful information from uploaded PDF documents. It then crafts interactive story games where users can engage with the content through conversations and challenges inspired by the PDFs.

## Features
PDF Processing: Extract text content from uploaded PDF documents using libraries such as PyPDF2 and pdfplumber.
NLP and Machine Learning: Utilize NLP libraries like NLTK and spaCy, as well as pre-trained machine learning models like OpenAI GPT and Hugging Face Transformers, to process text and generate storylines.
Interactive Story Games: Create interactive storytelling experiences where users can ask questions, make decisions, and solve challenges based on the content of their PDF documents.
Web Application: Implement the Chatbot as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to easily upload PDFs and interact with the story games through a user-friendly interface.
